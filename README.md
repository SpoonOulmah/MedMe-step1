## CS50
>This was my final project to conclude the CS50's Introduction to Computer Sciense course.

>CS50 library for python, python, flask, flask web framework, bootstraps, web development, CS50
## Features

- [Sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
- [Bootstraps](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Cs50 Docs](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/libraries/cs50/python/)

I've used Flask web framework based in Python for Back-ending
To manage data I used Sqlite3 for creating Database called University.db
I utilised Bootsraps open-source styling on my platform.
The CS50 library is used for interactions between the flask framework and Sqlite3.
I also used the pre-made template apology message from helpers.py from CS50 week 9 PSET.

## Explaining the project functionality and the database
My final project is a website that is directed to Biomedical students in Khartoum University. It is a Question Book application that provides the students with testing materials to go over and prepare from.

All of information associated with the students like usernames, Hash-passwords, number of correct answers, number of incorrect answers and the total questions completed are stored in a table called users in university.db database.

For question-related data, they are stored in a seperate table called questions in university.db, where the questions prompts, candidate answers, correct answer and explaination for each question are kept and passed from ayes
There is a hero for the weboste to go for doing questions or to look on the profile.
The websites gives a breif background about khartoum university.
Also a quick info about the developer.
And Finally, in the Home Page, a table shows some of the University Colleges.

### Retrieving questions from the database and thier corresponing answers and explaination.
The heading tag in the quize.html page is going to be a place holder for a certain question at a time based on the current value comming from the users table per the current occupied session of the user who logged-in.

The answers are going to be held in the select tag and written on the page using Djinja syntax one by one.

```python
current_question_id = db.execute("SELECT current FROM users WHERE id = ?", session["user_id"])[0]["current"]

        try:
            question = db.execute("SELECT * FROM questions WHERE id = ?", current_question_id)
            answer1 = question[0]["answer1"]
            answer2 = question[0]["answer2"]
            answer3 = question[0]["answer3"]
            answer4 = question[0]["answer4"]
            answer_correct = question[0]["correct"]
            answers = [answer1, answer2, answer3, answer4]

            return render_template("quize.html", question=question[0]["question"], answers=answers, number=current_question_id)
```

### The logic to check the answer weather it is correct or not.

```python
if not session["user_id"]:
            redirect("/login")

        current_question_id = db.execute("SELECT current FROM users WHERE id = ?", session["user_id"])[0]["current"]
        question = db.execute("SELECT * FROM questions WHERE id = ?", current_question_id)
        answer_correct = question[0]["correct"]

        selected_answer = request.form.get("answer")
        correct = db.execute("SELECT correct FROM users WHERE id = ?", session["user_id"])[0]["correct"]
        incorrect = db.execute("SELECT incorrect FROM users WHERE id = ?", session["user_id"])[0]["incorrect"]
        total_questions = current_question_id

        if selected_answer == answer_correct:
            correct = correct + 1
            try:
                db.execute("UPDATE users SET correct = ? WHERE id = ?", correct, session["user_id"])
                db.execute("UPDATE users SET completed = ? WHERE id = ?", total_questions, session["user_id"])
                return redirect("/correct")

            except:
                db.execute("UPDATE users SET current = 1 WHERE id = ?", session["user_id"])
                db.execute("UPDATE users SET correct = 0 WHERE id = ?", session["user_id"])
                b.execute("UPDATE users SET incorrect = 0 WHERE id = ?", session["user_id"])
                db.execute("UPDATE users SET completed = 0 WHERE id = ?", session["user_id"])
                return apology("you have completed the Question Book!")

        else:
            incorrect = incorrect + 1
            global wrong_answer
            wrong_answer = selected_answer
            try:
                db.execute("UPDATE users SET incorrect = ? WHERE id = ?", incorrect, session["user_id"])
                db.execute("UPDATE users SET completed = ? WHERE id = ?", total_questions, session["user_id"])
                return redirect("/incorrect")

            except:
                    db.execute("UPDATE users SET current = 1 WHERE id = ?", session["user_id"])
                    db.execute("UPDATE users SET correct = 0 WHERE id = ?", session["user_id"])
                    b.execute("UPDATE users SET incorrect = 0 WHERE id = ?", session["user_id"])
                    db.execute("UPDATE users SET completed = 0 WHERE id = ?", session["user_id"])
                    return apology("you have completed the Question Book!")

```
